Rocuronium bromide was used as the muscle relaxant. The defibrillator was ready for use with the electrodes on the patient. Sugammadex was used for muscle relaxant antagonization. Postoperative analgesia was provided by intermittent morphine HCL via an epidural catheter, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (Meperidine), and intravenous tenoxicam. The patient was discharged on the 6th day without any problem. Anaesthetic management of patients with BrS is challenging for anaesthesiologists, because fatal cardiac arrhythmias can be triggered by many drugs commonly used in the perioperative period such as bupivacaine, lidocaine, neostigmine, propofol, succinylcholine, ketamine, and tramadol. In these cases, a detailed preoperative evaluation including family history, avoidance of drugs triggering arrhythmia, taking precautions against arrhythmia, and using the agents that are reported to be safe are essential for patient safety.", "background": "", "objective": "", "methods": "", "results": "", "conclusions": ""}, "sections": [], "authors": [{"lastName": "Tuncal\u0131", "firstName": "Bahattin", "initials": "B", "affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation, Ba\u015fkent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}, {"lastName": "K\u00f6kten", "firstName": "Gizem", "initials": "G", "affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation, Ba\u015fkent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}, {"lastName": "Alt\u0131n", "firstName": "Cihan", "initials": "C", "affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Ba\u015fkent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "firstAffiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation, Ba\u015fkent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.", "chemicalList": [], "mesh": [], "keywords": ["Anaesthesia", "Brugada syndrome", "ECG", "knee arthroplasty"], "dates": {"pubmed": "2021-03-16", "entrez": "2021-03-15", "medline": "2021-03-16", "received": "2019-12-08", "revised": "2021-03-16", "accepted": "2020-02-09", "contribution": ""}, "search": {"productNames": ["Lidazon 1,25 mg + 1 mg comprimido para chupar", "Otalgan 5 mg/g oordruppels"], "customerNames": ["Swiss Pharma"], "activeSubstances": ["lidocaine"], "searchProfiles": [{"customerName": "Swiss Pharma", "productName": "Otalgan 5 mg/g oordruppels", "activeSubstance": "lidocaine", "firstUploaded": "2021-03-03T12:48:32.652952", "searchProfileId": "6e8c89c3-da45-4dfa-b3c1-d49a1154f6ff"}, {"customerName": "Swiss Pharma", "productName": "Lidazon 1,25 mg + 1 mg comprimido para chupar", "activeSubstance": "lidocaine", "firstUploaded": "2021-03-03T12:48:31.711593", "searchProfileId": "0090e623-be5a-4b7c-9cee-912d5f52b0c1"}], "searchQueries": ["(\"lidocaine\"[Text Word]) AND (\"2021/03/16\"[EDAT] : \"2021/03/16\"[EDAT])"], "searchDates": ["2021-03-16"]}, "meta": {"nUpserts": 1, "timestamps": {"lastUpsert": "2021-03-17T02:06:55.839914", "lastAnnotation": "2021-03-20"}, "versions": {"pipeline": 0.8, "searcher": 0.4, "downloader": 0.7, "xmlParser": 0.6}, "status": {"umlsTagged": 1, "patternTagged": 1, "reportCompiled": 0, "modelClassified": 0, "expertClassified": 0}}, "id": "082fbdb4-df66-40b6-b4fd-68917c87a42d", "_rid": "ft8qAOS9vPGBPgAAAAAAAA==", "_self": "dbs/ft8qAA==/colls/ft8qAOS9vPE=/docs/ft8qAOS9vPGBPgAAAAAAAA==/", "_etag": "\"1400483a-0000-0d00-0000-605591c50000\"", "_attachments": "attachments/", "_ts": 1616220613}, {"title": "Pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome complicated with terminal pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with intra-articular knee aspiration, intra-articular lidocaine and corticosteroid injection, and decompression of panniculitis: A case report.", "pmid": "33717781", "pmcid": "", "doi": "10.1002/jgf2.398", "otherIds": {}, "publicationTypes": ["Case Reports"], "book": {}, "journal": {"issn": "2189-7948", "title": "Journal of general and family medicine", "abbreviation": "J Gen Fam Med", "volume": "22", "issue": "2", "year": "2021"}, "abstract": {"unassigned": "Pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis (PPP) syndrome is a rare triad of hyperlipasemia, erythematous cutaneous nodules, and oligo- or mono-arthritis and a rare complication of pancreatic diseases.

effective pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant psychosis. It is also associated with low rates of extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia compared to other antipsychotic drugs. However, clozapine tends to be underutilized in clinical practice due to a number of disabling and serious side-effects. These are characterized by a constellation of metabolic side-effects which include dysregulation of glucose, insulin, plasma lipids and body fat. Many patients treated with clozapine go on to develop metabolic syndrome at a higher rate than the general population, which predisposes them for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Treatments for the metabolic side-effects of clozapine vary in their efficacy. There is also a lack of knowledge about the underlying physiology of how clozapine exerts its metabolic effects in humans. In the current review, we focus on key studies which describe how clozapine affects each of the main symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, and cover some of the treatment options. The clinical data are then discussed in the context of preclinical studies that have been conducted to identify the key biological substrates involved, in order to provide a better integrated overview.

polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions with both prescription and non-prescription drugs in older home-dwelling individuals. Close monitoring of the patients at risk of drug-drug interactions, and increased awareness of the potential of over-the-counter drugs to cause drug-drug interactions, is needed.", "background": "Risks associated with polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions represent a challenge in drug treatment, especially in older adults. The aim of the present study was to assess the use of prescription and non-prescription drugs and the frequency of potential drug-drug interactions in home-dwelling older individuals.", "objective": "", "methods": "A cross-sectional study design was applied. Data were collected during preventive home visits among individuals aged \u226575 in three separate communities of Western Norway. A questionnaire, which was filled out by the individual, their next-of-kin, and the nurse performing the home visit was used for the collection of demographic and clinical data (age, sex, medication use, diagnoses, need of assistance with drug administration). Potential drug-drug interactions were identified electronically by IBM Micromedex Drug Interaction Checking. Point prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions and polypharmacy (\u22655 drugs) were calculated. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors potentially associated with polypharmacy or potential drug-drug interactions.", "results": "Among the 233 individuals (mean age 78\u00b13 years, 46% male) included in the study, 43% used \u22655 drugs, 3.4% \u226510 drugs, while 4.3% used no drugs. In 54% of the 197 individuals using two or more drugs, at least one potential drug-drug interaction was detected. Low-dose aspirin and simvastatin were most frequently involved in potential drug-drug interactions. In total, 25% of the individuals reported current use of drugs sold over the counter of which more than 95% were analgesic drugs. Potential drug-drug interactions involving ibuprofen were identified in nine of 11 (82%) individuals using over-the-counter ibuprofen.", "conclusions": ""}, "sections": [], "authors": [{"lastName":

Methods: This study recruited 76 pediatric patients with VVS and 15 healthy children. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in serum among the participants were evaluated. Heart rate variability analysis including SDNN, rMSSD, and SDANN was tested in patients with VVS. The correlation between indices of time-domain analysis and serum vitamin D status of the children with VVS was investigated. Results: In this work, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in serum among VVS cases remarkably decreased compared with those among healthy controls (48.76 \u00b1 19.25 vs. 67.62 \u00b1 15.46 nmol/L, p < 0.01). The vitamin D deficient patients with VVS exhibited a lower rMSDD value compared to the non-deficient group with VVS (45.56 \u00b1 16.87 vs. 61.90 \u00b1 20.38 ms, p < 0.001, respectively). Pearson correlation analysis indicated that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels had positive correlation with rMSDD values ( r = 0.466, p < 0.001).

Moreover, the evidence of previous studies about this topic remained inconclusive. This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis concerning the relation between the risk of major bleeding and the use of different DAPT (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in ACS patients treated with CABG. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted during March to October 2019. Searches were carried out in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The predictor covariate in our present study was DAPT (clopidogrel or ticagrelor), and the outcome measure was the risk of major bleeding. Sub-group analysis was also performed, where data were classified into pre- and post-CABG. Furthermore, to determine the correlation and effect estimation, data were analyzed using fixed or random effect model. Results: A total of 13 studies consisting 34,015 patients treated with clopidogrel and 32,661 patients treated with ticagrelor was included in our study. Our pooled calculation revealed that the incidence of major bleeding was not different significantly between clopidogrel and ticagrelor. In pre- and post-CABG sub-groups, our results also found no significant difference in major bleeding incidence between clopidogrel and ticagrelor groups. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis clarifies that clopidogrel, compared to ticagrelor, or vice versa, is not associated with the risk of major bleeding in ACS patients treated with CABG.", "background":

immunity. Cancer patients treated with combination of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy exhibit superior clinical outcomes and tolerance compared with patients treated with monotherapies. However, immutherapy is associated with several concomitant immune-related adverse events (irAEs). For instance, IrAEs interferes with function of gastrointestinal tract, endocrine, dermatological, nervous system and musculoskeletal systems. ICIs-associated pancreatic injury might causes decrease in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function, resulting in metabolic and nutritional disorders. Clinicians who administer immune checkpoint inhibitors to cancer patients are diagnosed with hyperglycemia, abdominal pain and steatorrhea.

Mycophenolate mofetil is a well-tolerated alternative with limited data. Institutional review board approval was obtained to review patients from a single institution who received mycophenolate mofetil for pyoderma gangrenosum between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. A systematic MEDLINE (PubMed) review was performed of articles containing linked keywords: \"mycophenolate mofetil\" and \"pyoderma gangrenosum\". Patient demographics, presentation details, and treatment regimen characteristics were recorded. Fourteen of our pyoderma gangrenosum patients were treated with mycophenolate mofetil concomitantly with prednisone.

We report a case of severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis in a 28-year-old male, chronic alcoholic, who on readmission developed features of cystitis.

Tregs depend on fatty acids via \u03b2-oxidation for immunosuppressive function adapting their antioxidant systems to allow survival to oxidative stress. In this study, we have hypothesized that a dietary supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a powerful antioxidant, would improve immunometabolism when added to the classical strategy of obesity treatment. First, we showed by in vitro experiments that ALA favors the polarization of mice CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cells toward Tregs. Next, we have carried out a translational study where female obese mice and women were supplemented with ALA or vehicle/placebo (mice: 2.5 g ALA /kg food ; 6\u00a0weeks ; women: 600 mg ALA /day, 8\u00a0weeks) while following a protocol including regular exercise and a change in diet. Fatty acid oxidation potential and activity of nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) of mouse secondary lymphoid tissues were improved by ALA supplementation. ALA reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and preserved Tregs in VAT in mice. In women, ALA supplementation induced significant metabolic changes of circulating CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cells including increased oxidative capacity and fatty acid oxidation, ameliorated their redox status, and improved the reduction of visceral fat mass. While appropriate biological markers are still required to be used in clinics to judge the effectiveness of long-term obesity treatment, further studies in female mice and women are needed to determine whether these immunometabolic changes would reduce VAT mass-associated risk for secondary health issues arising from obesity.", "background": "", "objective": "", "methods": "", "results":

Moreover, the evidence of previous studies about this topic remained inconclusive. This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis concerning the relation between the risk of major bleeding and the use of different DAPT (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in ACS patients treated with CABG. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted during March to October 2019. Searches were carried out in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The predictor covariate in our present study was DAPT (clopidogrel or ticagrelor), and the outcome measure was the risk of major bleeding. Sub-group analysis was also performed, where data were classified into pre- and post-CABG. Furthermore, to determine the correlation and effect estimation, data were analyzed using fixed or random effect model. Results: A total of 13 studies consisting 34,015 patients treated with clopidogrel and 32,661 patients treated with ticagrelor was included in our study. Our pooled calculation revealed that the incidence of major bleeding was not different significantly between clopidogrel and ticagrelor. In pre- and post-CABG sub-groups, our results also found no significant difference in major bleeding incidence between clopidogrel and ticagrelor groups. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis clarifies that clopidogrel, compared to ticagrelor, or vice versa, is not associated with the risk of major bleeding in ACS patients treated with CABG.", "background": "", "objective": "", "methods": "", "results": "", "conclusions": ""}, "sections": [], "authors": [{"lastName": "Rohman", "firstName": "Mohammad Saifur", "initials": "MS", "affiliation": "Brawijaya Cardiovascular Research Center, Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Purnamasari", "firstName": "Yeni", "initials": "Y", "affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Ilmawan", "firstName": "Muhammad", "initials": "M", "affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Mahdi", "firstName": "Bagus Aulia", "initials": "BA", "affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, East Java, 60115, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Tamara", "firstName": "Fredo", "initials": "F", "affiliation": "Brawijaya Internal Medicine Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Mahendra", "firstName": "Aditya Indra", "initials": "AI", "affiliation": "Brawijaya Internal Medicine Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Mazen", "firstName": "Mazen", "initials": "M", "affiliation": "Brawijaya Internal Medicine Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Heriansyah", "firstName": "Teuku", "initials": "T", "affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Aceh, 23111, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Yamin", "firstName": "Muhammad", "initials": "M", "affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Jakarta, 16424, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Pikir", "firstName": "Budi Susetio", "initials": "BS", "affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, East Java, 60115, Indonesia."}, {"lastName": "Fajar", "firstName": "Jonny Karunia", "initials": "JK", "affiliation": "Brawijaya Internal Medicine Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia."}], "firstAffiliation": "Brawijaya Cardiovascular Research Center, Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, East Java, 65145, Indonesia.", "chemicalList": [], "mesh": [], "keywords": ["clopidogrel", "coronary artery bypass grafting", "major bleeding", "ticagrelor"], "dates": {"pubmed": "2021-03-23", "entrez": "2021-03-22", "medline": "2021-03-23", "received": "", "revised": "2021-03-22", "accepted": "2020-09-04", "contribution": ""}, "search": {"productNames": ["clopidogrel-biomo 75 mg Filmtabletten"], "customerNames": ["Biomo"], "activeSubstances": ["clopidogrel"], "searchProfiles": [{"customerName": "Biomo", "productName": "clopidogrel-biomo 75 mg Filmtabletten", "activeSubstance": "clopidogrel", "firstUploaded": "2021-03-03T12:46:41.384643", "searchProfileId": "59d20794-9a52-4d22-b77c-46339c2fcfbe"}], "searchQueries": ["(\"clopidogrel\"[Text Word]) AND (\"2021/03/23\"[EDAT] : \"2021/03/23\"[EDAT])"], "searchDates": ["2021-03-23"]}, "meta": {"nUpserts": 1, "timestamps": {"lastUpsert": "2021-03-24T02:15:23.424603"}, "versions": {"pipeline": 0.8, "searcher": 0.4, "downloader": 0.7, "xmlParser": 0.6}, "status": {"umlsTagged": 0, "patternTagged": 0, "reportCompiled": 0, "modelClassified": 0, "expertClassified": 0}}, "id": "026cd041-008d-40b4-8d32-a18067c42ee5", "_rid": "ft8qAOS9vPF6QAAAAAAAAA==", "_self": "dbs/ft8qAA==/colls/ft8qAOS9vPE=/docs/ft8qAOS9vPF6QAAAAAAAAA==/", "_etag": "\"0c01a42b-0000-0d00-0000-606204f60000\"", "_attachments": "attachments/", "_ts": 1617036534}]
